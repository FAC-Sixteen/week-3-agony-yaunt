        <h3>Episode iV: A New Request</h3>
    <p>The year is 2019, and FAC16 are scattered across time and Space4. Groups hurry to complete their projects.
      Little do they know, the Intergalactic Council of Fun-Sounding But Poorly Documented APis has other plans.</p>
    <p>Brandishing the dark arts of recursive programming, Chancellors Sac and Martin have charged the Rebellion with learning the secrets of the APi dual-wield.</p>
    <p>in dis[array] and out of ideas, our four jedi seek counsel from the one they call “Yoda”, who has not been seen since the Callback Wars of 2019 (last week).</p>
    <p>Will they find the answers they seek? Or will fake Yodas whose APis are rate limited to 5 calls an hour foil their plans?</p>
