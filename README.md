This repo contains our Founders and Coders Week 3 project. After learning about and practicing working with APIs to request information from the internet, we set to work on creating our own web app utilising (at least) two APIs.

The website is live on GitHub pages. Access it using [this link](https://fac-sixteen.github.io/week-3-agony-yaunt/public/)!

## :floppy_disk: How to install the project 

1. `git clone git@github.com:FAC-Sixteen/week-3-agony-yaunt.git`
2. cd into the directory
3. run `npm i` to install node modules
4. `npm test` can be run for the (minimal) tests
5. open the local index.html file

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Our process  
1. brainstormed ideas
2. selected one final idea and researched the APIs
3. drew up a mock design and ideal features
> <img src="./public/assets/mockdesign.png"> 
4. plotted out the software architecture
> <img src="./public/assets/architecture.png"> 
5. second draft of design
6. made a task list
7. created initial API functions
8. chained together functions with DOM and callbacks
9. styled to the max

## 🏋️‍ What we struggled with  
- finding an appropriate API
- CORS 
> ![CORS](https://media.giphy.com/media/d2W7eZX5z62ziqdi/giphy.gif) 
- No way to test XMLHttpRequest functions without browser
- Importing functions to dom.js
- recursion + async = no-no

## :bulb: What we learned
